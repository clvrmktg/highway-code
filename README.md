## 📖 About

The *Bahamas Highway Code Online* is the digital version of the official Highway Code of The Bahamas.  
It is designed to be:

- **Accessible** — clear navigation, mobile-first, WCAG-compliant.  
- **Public-good** — free for all users, with no login required.  
- **Educational** — supports learner drivers, parents, schools, and tourists.  
- **Authoritative** — based on the official Highway Code booklet.  

The companion book — **Bahamas Highway Code Exam Prep Guide** — provides structured study support and practice tests to help learners pass the driver’s exam (75% pass mark required).

## 🗂️ Site Structure

The site is organized into 5 main sections:

- **Rules** (drivers, pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists)  
- **Signs & Markings** (regulatory, warning, informational)  
- **Law** (licensing, penalties, offences, alcohol)  
- **Emergencies** (breakdowns, crashes, first aid basics)  
- **Children & Visitors** (short code for kids, guidance for tourists)  

A free-text **search** and **in-page expandable navigation** make it easy to jump to relevant rules.
