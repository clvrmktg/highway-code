# Accessibility Statement

**Last Updated:** {{<date>}}

At **Bahamas Highway Code Online**, we are committed to making our website accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. We want all visitors to be able to access the information and services we provide without barriers.

---

## Our Commitment

We aim to meet the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, Level AA** standards, recognized internationally as the benchmark for web accessibility. These guidelines help make content more usable for people with a wide range of abilities and assistive technologies.

---

## Accessibility Features

We have taken steps to improve accessibility, including:

- **Keyboard Navigation** – The site can be navigated without a mouse.  
- **Screen Reader Compatibility** – We use semantic HTML, descriptive link text, and alternative text for images.  
- **Color Contrast** – Text and background colors meet WCAG contrast requirements for readability.  
- **Clear Structure** – Proper heading hierarchy and ARIA attributes support assistive technologies.  
- **Accessible Forms** – All form fields are clearly labeled for ease of use.

## Ongoing Efforts

We regularly review our content and features to maintain and improve accessibility. Periodic audits help us identify and resolve issues as web standards and technology evolve.

---

## Third-Party Content

Some features (such as Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, or embedded third-party content) are provided by external services. While we do not control the accessibility of their content, we aim to use services that align with our accessibility goals.
