# Children & Visitors

This section of the Road Traffic Guide covers two important groups:

- **Children** â€” the youngest and most vulnerable road users. Learning basic rules early helps keep them safe whether walking, cycling, or riding as passengers.
- **Visitors** â€” tourists and non-residents driving in The Bahamas. Clear rules ensure that visitors can drive safely and legally while respecting local laws.

- Tips for crossing the road safely
