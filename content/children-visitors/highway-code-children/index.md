# Highway Code for Children

Children are among the most vulnerable road users. Learning and following simple rules helps keep everyone safe.

## Crossing the Road
- **Stop** at the edge of the sidewalk or road.  
- **Look** left, right, and left again.  
- **Listen** for approaching traffic.  
- **Think** before you cross — only step out when it's safe.  
- Always cross at a **pedestrian crossing** when one is nearby.  

---

## Walking Safely
- Walk on the **sidewalk**. If there is none, walk on the right-hand side of the road facing traffic.  
- Hold an adult's hand near busy roads.  
- Wear bright or reflective clothing when walking at night.

## Riding Bicycles
- Always wear a **helmet**.  
- Ride on the **left side** of the road, in single file.  
- Obey traffic signals and road signs just like cars do.  
- Use lights and reflectors at night.
