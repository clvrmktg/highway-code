## Special Considerations

- **Visibility:** Use hazard lights, warning triangles, and reflective gear so approaching drivers can see your vehicle.  
- **Personal safety:** Keep doors locked, be cautious with strangers, and only accept help from official roadside services or someone you trust.  
- **Positioning:** At night, switch on your interior light. If you must stand outside, stay well off the roadway, behind a barrier if possible.

## Flat Tires

A flat tire is the most common cause of a breakdown.  
Follow the same basic safety steps — pull over, hazard lights, and a warning triangle — before deciding what to do next.

- On quiet roads: you may change the tire yourself if you have the right tools and it is safe.  
- On busy roads or highways: stay in your vehicle and call for roadside assistance.
