# Crashes

## For Passengers

Passengers are also protected under the law:  

- If injured, ensure details are taken at the scene.  
- You may file a police report yourself.  
- Medical treatment should be documented for insurance.  
- Passengers have the right to claim against the driver or vehicle owner’s insurance.  

{{< callout type="info" title="Tip for Passengers" >}}
Do not leave the scene without making sure your details and injuries are recorded.  
This protects your rights if you need to make an insurance claim later.
