- Drivers should be prepared to give simple first aid until emergency services arrive.{{< footnote id="1" >}}

- Casualties must not be moved unless there is immediate danger.{{< footnote id="1" >}}

## Good Practice

{{< checklist title="First Aid at the Scene" >}}
- **Check for danger** — ensure the area is safe before helping.  
- **Call 911** — request ambulance or police assistance.  
- **Check responsiveness** — tap and speak to the person.  
- **Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC):**  
  - Open the airway with head tilt–chin lift.  
    {{< figure src="/images/first-aid/head-tilt-chin-lift.jpg" alt="Head tilt–chin lift to open the airway" >}}  
  - Look, listen, and feel for breathing.  
  - If not breathing, begin CPR (30 chest compressions, 2 rescue breaths).  
    {{< figure src="/images/first-aid/cpr-hand-placement.jpg" alt="Correct hand placement for CPR" >}}  
- **Control bleeding** — apply firm, direct pressure with a clean cloth.  
- **Keep them calm and warm** until professional help arrives.

## Special Considerations

- **Severe bleeding:** Apply pressure directly and elevate if possible.  
- **Unconscious but breathing:** Place in the recovery position.  
  {{< figure src="/images/first-aid/recovery-position.jpg" alt="Recovery position step-by-step" >}}  
- **Burns:** Cool with clean water for at least 10 minutes; never apply grease or ice.  
- **Shock:** Lay the person down, raise legs slightly, and cover with a blanket.  
- **When not to move someone:** Only move if there is fire, explosion risk, or traffic danger.{{< footnote id="1" >}}

## Exam Pointers

- You must know the **ABC checks** (Airway, Breathing, Circulation).{{< footnote id="1" >}}  
- Expect questions like: *“What should you do if someone is unconscious but breathing?”* → place them in the recovery position.  
- You should know: **never move an injured person unless there is immediate danger**.{{< footnote id="1" >}}

{{< callout type="tip" title="Study Tip" >}}
- Be ready for exam questions on **ABC checks** and **recovery position**.  
- Examiners may ask why you must not move casualties unnecessarily — the safe answer is to prevent worsening spinal injuries.  
- Cross-check with [Crash Steps](/emergencies/crash-steps/) for duties after an accident, and [Fire & Flood](/emergencies/fire-flood/) for when moving someone may be unavoidable.
