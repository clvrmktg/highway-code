  question = "Is this the official Highway Code of The Bahamas?"
  answer = """
  No. **Bahamas Highway Code Online** is an **educational resource** based on the official *Highway Code*, the *Road Traffic Act*, and current amendments. It’s designed to make the rules easier to study and use, but it does **not** replace official government publications.
  """

  [[faqs.items]]
  question = "How is the site organized?"
  answer = """
  The site is structured to mirror how people actually learn and look things up:

  - **Rules** — practical guidance explained in plain language, with examples and legal references.  
  - **Signs, Markings & Signals** — meanings, categories, and how to respond.  
  - **Law** — key parts of the *Road Traffic Act* and amendments with clearer context.  
  - **Emergencies** — what to do when things go wrong (breakdowns, crashes, first aid basics).  
  - **Children & Visitors** — simplified essentials for young learners and people new to The Bahamas.  
  - **Extras** — this section (About, FAQ, Glossary) for orientation and study support.  
  """

  [[faqs.items]]
  question = "Will this site help me pass the driving exam?"
  answer = """
  Yes—**with an important note**. The official Highway Code can sometimes be **insufficient or not fully aligned** with exam questions. This site aims to **bridge that gap** by adding clearer explanations, examples, and cross-references so your study time maps better to both the **law** *and* the **exam**.
  """

  [[faqs.items]]
  question = "Why focus so much on accessibility?"
  answer = """
  Many learners struggle not with driving, but with **how** the material is presented. We use **plain language**, high contrast, readable typography, mobile-friendly layouts, consistent page patterns, summaries, and a **glossary**—so the rules are easier to absorb for everyone, including those with reading challenges or test anxiety.
  """

  [[faqs.items]]
  question = "Is the information complete and up to date?"
  answer = """
  The site is a **work in progress**. Some sections are still being written or reviewed. We actively incorporate **legal updates** and improve pages over time, but you may encounter places marked for expansion or revision.
  """

  [[faqs.items]]
  question = "How can I give feedback on a page?"
  answer = """
  At the bottom of each page, you can let us know if it was **helpful**. If not, you can also report if there’s a **content issue** (like missing, unclear, or outdated information) or a **technical problem** with the page. Every bit of feedback helps us make the site better.
  """

  [[faqs.items]]
  question = "Can I support the site financially?"
  answer = """
  Yes. This project is maintained independently, and every improvement—whether it’s creating graphics, adding explanations, or dedicating developer time—takes resources.  

  - **Donate** — Individual contributions help cover ongoing costs.  
  - **Sponsor** — Businesses can support road safety and visibility by becoming sponsors.  

  Your support helps keep the site free and accessible for learners, drivers, and visitors in The Bahamas.
