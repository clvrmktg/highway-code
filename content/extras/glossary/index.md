## Notes on Interpretation
The Act also clarifies:  

- A vehicle is considered to carry passengers “for hire or reward” if any payment is made in connection with the ride, no matter who receives it.  
- Hotel/guest house guests or club members carried in vehicles owned or operated by those establishments are normally considered carried “for hire or reward.” However, the Controller can allow exceptions (for distinguished visitors or special reasons).  
- A payment counts as a fare even if it covers more than just the ride.  
- Workers carried by their employer to/from work in an employer’s vehicle are **not** considered carried for hire or reward.  
- The term “public” includes tourists and visitors to The Bahamas.
