# Support Bahamas Highway Code Online

**Bahamas Highway Code Online** is an independent, community-minded project. Every page, diagram, and improvement takes time and resources — from designing clear graphics to keeping up with law changes and site maintenance.

Your support helps us:
- Create **clear visuals** for complex rules and road signs.  
- Keep content **current** with legal updates and amendments.  
- Fund **developer time** for accessibility, performance, and new features.  
- Expand learning tools for **students, visitors, and new drivers**.
