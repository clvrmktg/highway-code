## Laws of the Road

Driving in The Bahamas comes with responsibilities. The law sets clear rules for who can drive, how vehicles must be licensed and insured, and what happens if those rules are broken.  

Understanding these requirements is not only essential for safe driving — it’s also a major part of preparing for the driving test.  

{{< callout type="info" title="What’s New (2024 Amendments)" >}}
- **Insurance proof:** Drivers must carry a current insurance certificate in the vehicle at all times.  
- **Impoundment:** Police may seize uninsured or unlicensed vehicles on the spot; $300 release fee applies.  
- **Policy rules:** In order to licence your vehicle, insurance must be valid for at least 6 months, renewed in your birth month, and surrendered if cancelled.  
- **Demerit points:** Expanded system for offences — 12 points in 12 months can mean suspension.

This section covers the most important legal topics for road users:

- [**Licensing & Tests**](/law/licensing-tests/)  
  What you need to know about learner’s permits, the knowledge and road tests, and getting a full licence.  

- [**Special Licences**](/law/special-licences/)  
  Public Service Driver’s Licence and other special categories — who’s eligible (e.g., BahamaHost certified, 21 years or older, 3+ years licensed), what tests/interviews are required, and how to apply.  

- [**Insurance & Documents**](/law/insurance-documents/)  
  The documents every driver must carry, new 2024 insurance requirements, rules for renewal and cancellation, and the penalties for failing to produce them.  

- [**Vehicle Standards & Equipment**](/law/vehicle-standards-equipment/)  
  The minimum safety standards for all vehicles — lights, tyres, mirrors, horns, exhausts, and how to mark and secure loads.  

- [**Speed Limits**](/law/speed-limits/)  
  National speed limits in The Bahamas — 25 mph in settlements, 30 mph outside city limits, and 45 mph in rural areas — plus penalties for exceeding them.  

- [**Seatbelts & Child Restraints**](/law/seatbelts-child-restraints/)  
  Who must wear a seatbelt, requirements for child seats, and the fines for failing to comply.  

- [**Penalties & Offences**](/law/penalties-offences/)  
  Common offences, fixed penalties, demerit points, vehicle impoundment, and how serious cases are handled in court.  

- [**Alcohol & Driving**](/law/alcohol-driving/)  
  Legal alcohol limits in The Bahamas — **80 {{< abbr "mg" "milligrams" >}} of alcohol per 100 {{< abbr "ml" "millilitres" >}} of blood** and **30 {{< abbr "µg" "micrograms" >}} of alcohol per 100 {{< abbr "ml" "millilitres" >}} of breath** — why even small amounts are dangerous, and the consequences of driving impaired.  

  {{< callout type="info" title="For International Readers" >}}
  Legal alcohol limits equal about 0.08% {{< abbr "BAC" "Blood Alcohol Concentration" >}} in blood and 0.03% {{< abbr "BAC" "Blood Alcohol Concentration" >}} in breath.
