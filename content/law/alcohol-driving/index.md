## Alcohol & Driving

Alcohol affects judgment, reaction time, and coordination. Even small amounts can impair your ability to drive safely. The Road Traffic Act sets specific limits for alcohol in the body, and exceeding these is an offence with serious consequences.

## Legal Limits

In The Bahamas, it is an offence to drive if you exceed these limits:{{< footnote id="2" >}}  
- **30 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath** (≈ **0.03% {{<abbr "BAC" "Blood Alcohol Concentration" >}}**)  
- **80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood** (≈ **0.08% {{<abbr "BAC" "Blood Alcohol Concentration" >}}**)  

These limits are low because even a small amount of alcohol can make driving unsafe. 

{{< callout type="info" title="What is BAC?" >}}
**Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)** is the standard way of measuring how much alcohol is in your body.  
- **Blood standard:** 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood = **0.08% BAC**.  
- **Breath standard:** 30 micrograms of alcohol in 100 ml of breath ≈ **0.03% BAC** (equivalent to the blood standard above).  

BAC matters because laws use these limits to define when you are legally “over the limit.” Even small amounts of alcohol can impair driving.

## Effects on Driving

Alcohol reduces:  
- Reaction time — making it harder to stop or avoid hazards  
- Coordination — affecting steering and control  
- Judgment — leading to poor decisions like speeding or risky overtaking  

The safest level of alcohol for drivers is **zero**.
