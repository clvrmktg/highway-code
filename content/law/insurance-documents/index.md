# Insurance & Documents

Every driver in The Bahamas must carry proof of both **identity and insurance**. These rules ensure that all vehicles on the road are properly licensed, insured, and accountable in the event of an accident.

{{< toc >}}

## Documents You Must Carry
When driving, you are legally required to have:  
- A **valid driver's licence**  
- A **current, active insurance certificate**  

These documents must be produced immediately when requested by a police officer {{< footnote id="1" >}}.  

---

## Validity of Insurance Policies

To **licence a vehicle**, the insurance certificate you present **must be valid for at least six months** from the date of application {{< footnote id="2" >}}.  

In practice:  
- Insurance certificates are **issued for one year**.  
- A certificate that will expire in less than six months **cannot be used** to licence a vehicle.  
- This rule ensures that only **active, long-term insurance policies** support licensed vehicles on the road.  

A policy **must be renewed annually in your birth month** {{< footnote id="3" >}}.  

**Early cancellation** is tightly restricted. A policy may only be cancelled within its term if the vehicle is:  
- Scrapped  
- Sold, or  
- Transferred to another vehicle you own  

If a policy is cancelled, the insured person **must**:  
1. Surrender the insurance certificate immediately to the insurer, and  
2. Notify the Road Traffic Controller within **5 days**, providing proof of the reason {{< footnote id="4" >}}.  

Failing to comply may lead to a fine of up to **$2,500 or 3 months' imprisonment**. Insurers who fail to report cancellations **must** pay fines of not less than **$5,000**.  

---

## Failure to Produce Documents
If you cannot produce a valid licence or insurance certificate when asked:  
- Police may **impound your vehicle** until valid documents are shown {{< footnote id="5" >}}  
- A **$300 release fee** applies, in addition to presenting the proper documents  
- Vehicles left impounded for more than one year may be sold by the Commissioner of Police

## Why It Matters
Carrying your licence and insurance is not optional — it is a legal requirement. These documents prove you are properly licensed and insured in case of an accident. Failing to produce them can leave you without a vehicle, paying high fines, and at risk of further penalties.
