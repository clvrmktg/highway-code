## Licensing & Tests

Before you can legally drive in The Bahamas, you must hold the correct licence for the vehicle you are operating. This section explains the steps to getting licensed and the tests you'll need to pass.

{{< toc >}}

---

## Minimum Age
- You must be **at least 17 years old** to apply for a provisional (learner's) licence {{< footnote id="1" >}}.  
- No one under 17 may legally hold or apply for a driver's licence.  

---

## Learner's Permit
- A provisional licence (or learner's permit) allows you to **practice driving** under supervision.  
- It is valid for **6 months** from the date of issue {{< footnote id="2" >}}.  
- You must carry it with you whenever you are driving.  
- Learners are expected to obey all traffic laws and may be tested at any time.  

---

## Knowledge Test
Before you can take the road test, you must pass a **written knowledge exam**.  

This test checks your understanding of:  
- The Highway Code and road signs  
- Basic traffic laws  
- Safe driving practices  

**Format:**  
- 40 multiple-choice questions  
- 40 minutes to finish  
- You must get at least **32 correct (80%)** to pass {{< footnote id="3" >}}  

{{< callout type="tip" title="Study Tip" >}}
The law uses **must** or **must not** to indicate legal requirements. Expect several test questions on when you **must stop**, **must give way**, or **must carry your licence**.

---

## Practical (Road) Test
After passing the knowledge test, you can take the **on-road driving test** {{< footnote id="4" >}}.  
The examiner will check that you can:  
- Control the vehicle safely (starting, stopping, reversing, parking)  
- Use mirrors and signals correctly  
- Follow the rules at junctions, roundabouts, and pedestrian crossings  
- Drive with due care and consideration for other road users  

You may also be asked to demonstrate specific maneuvers such as:  
- Emergency stop  
- Three-point turn  
- Reversing into a space or around a corner  

{{< callout type="info" title="Test Day Reminder" >}}
During the road test, examiners are watching more than your control of the vehicle — they look for safe habits like checking mirrors, signalling early, and showing awareness of pedestrians and other drivers.

## Full Licence
After you pass both the theory and practical exams, you can apply for a **full driver's licence**. This licence allows you to drive legally on public roads in The Bahamas.  

- **First-time licences** are valid for **1 year only** {{< footnote id="5" >}}.  
- After that, licences may be renewed for either **1 year (BS$25)** or **3 years (BS$75)**.  
- All licences expire at the **end of the holder's birth month** {{< footnote id="5" >}}.  

### How It's Issued
When you qualify, you'll visit the Road Traffic Department's Driver's Licence Unit. Your documents will be checked, your photo and signature will be captured, and once the fee is paid, your licence is printed. In most cases, it is issued **the same day** (though processing may take up to 3 business days in some situations).  

**What you need to bring:**  
- Passport (or other government-issued ID)  
- National Insurance Card  
- Pass certificate from the Road Traffic Department (proof of passing both exams)  
- For non-Bahamians: passport plus a permit to reside (Work Permit, Residency, Spousal, or Permanent Residency Permit)  

### Renewal
A licence must be renewed when it expires at the end of your birth month. Renewals can be done for **1 or 3 years**, with the same fees as above. At renewal, you will need to take a new photo in your first year, and you must notify the Department if there are any changes (such as name or address).  

**Turnaround times:**  
- New Providence Stadium Office & Freeport Office — **same day**  
- Carmichael Rd Office — **next day**  
- Abaco & Eleuthera Offices — **one week**  

### Transfer of Licence
If you already hold a valid driver's licence from another country or from a Family Island, you may apply for a **transfer** {{< footnote id="6" >}}. This usually requires an interview with the Chief Driving Examiner to check your knowledge of the Bahamas Highway Code.
