# Penalties & Offences

Breaking the Road Traffic Act has real consequences. Some violations are minor and handled with a fixed penalty notice (ticket), while others are serious offences that may lead to court action, heavy fines, licence suspension, vehicle impoundment, or even imprisonment.

## Fixed Penalty Notices
For minor traffic offences, police officers may issue a **fixed penalty notice**. This is essentially a ticket, and paying it within the required time usually settles the matter without going to court.

**Examples of fixed penalty offences:**  
- Improper parking (including parking on sidewalks) — up to $80  
- Failing to signal — about $100  
- Driving in a prohibited area  
- Having defective lights  

---

## Court Offences
More serious violations are dealt with in the **Magistrate's Court**. These cases can result in:  
- Larger fines  
- Licence suspension or disqualification  
- Vehicle impoundment  
- Imprisonment (for very serious offences or repeat offenders)  

**Examples include:**  
- Using a private vehicle for hire without a licence — fines of $500–$1,000  
- Unlicensed heavy-duty vehicle — $250 fine for a first offence; $400 or up to 3 months' imprisonment for repeat offences  
- Reckless driving causing death — up to 15 years' imprisonment  

---

## Insurance Offences
Driving without valid insurance is a **serious offence**.  

- Police may impound your vehicle immediately {{< footnote id="3" >}}.  
- A $300 release fee and proof of valid insurance are required for release.  
- Court action and fines may also apply.  

➡ See [Insurance & Documents](/law/insurance-documents/) for details on what documents you **must** carry and the rules for insurance policies.  

---

## Careless & Dangerous Driving
The Road Traffic Act distinguishes between **careless driving** and **dangerous driving**.  

- **Careless driving** happens when a driver fails to pay enough attention or drives without reasonable consideration for others. Examples include failing to signal, changing lanes suddenly, or blocking a junction. {{< footnote id="3" >}}  
- **Dangerous driving** is more serious. It means driving in a way that could clearly endanger life or property. Examples include overtaking where it is prohibited, running a STOP sign at speed, or reckless manoeuvres at junctions. {{< footnote id="2" >}}  

**Penalties:**  
- Careless driving: fines, 5 demerit points, and possible licence suspension.  
- Dangerous driving: higher fines, 7+ demerit points, and possible imprisonment.  
- Dangerous driving causing death: imprisonment up to 15 years.  

➡ Related rules: [Lane Discipline](/rules/lane-discipline/), [Overtaking](/rules/overtaking/), and [Junctions](/rules/junctions/).  

{{< callout type="tip" title="Study Tip" >}}
Remember: **careless** = not paying attention; **dangerous** = clear risk to life or property.  
{{< /callout >}}

## Mobile Phones & Distraction
Using a **hand-held mobile phone while driving is prohibited** under the Road Traffic Act.  

- You **must not** use a hand-held phone to make calls, text, or browse while driving {{< footnote id="5" >}}.  
- You **may** use a hands-free system, provided it does not cause distraction.  
- Even when legal, drivers remain responsible for keeping full control of the vehicle.  

**Penalties:**  
- Hand-held phone use while driving is punishable by a fixed penalty fine.  
- Offenders may also receive demerit points for driving without due care and attention.  

➡ See [Lane Discipline](/rules/lane-discipline/) and [Junctions](/rules/junctions/) — distraction often leads to failing to signal, poor lane control, or misjudging priorities.  

{{< callout type="tip" title="Study Tip" >}}
Expect exam questions like: *“Can you use your phone while driving?”* → Answer: only with hands-free, and never if it distracts you.  
{{< /callout >}}

## Vehicle Offences
It is also an offence to drive or allow a vehicle to be used if it is unsafe, noisy, or defective.  

- Driving with defective equipment (e.g. brakes, tyres, exhausts) may attract fines {{< footnote id="1" >}}.  
- Police may require you to repair faults immediately, and failing to do so can result in an $80 fine {{< footnote id="2" >}}.  

➡ See [Vehicle Standards & Equipment](/law/vehicle-standards-equipment/) for detailed requirements.  

---

## Vehicle Impoundment
Police officers have authority to impound vehicles in two cases:  
- The driver cannot produce a valid insurance certificate  
- The vehicle is unlicensed  

To release the vehicle, the owner must provide:  
- Proof of valid licence or insurance, and  
- Payment of a **$300 release fee**  

If a vehicle remains impounded for more than one year, the Commissioner of Police has authority to sell it, with proceeds applied to costs.  

---

## Demerit Points
In addition to fines or court penalties, certain offences carry **demerit points** {{< footnote id="4" >}}. These points are recorded against your licence when you are convicted.  

- Points remain on your record for 12 months.  
- If you accumulate **12 points or more within 12 months**, the Road Traffic Controller may suspend your licence.  
- Repeat or serious offenders may face longer suspensions or full disqualification.  

**Examples of demerit points:**  
- Failing to stop at a stop sign — 3 points  
- Overtaking dangerously — 4 points  
- Driving without due care and attention — 5 points  
- Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs — 10 points  

---

## Common Offences & Penalties
Some examples of offences and penalties under the Road Traffic Act include:  

- Failing to present a vehicle for inspection — $100  
- Failing to dip headlights for oncoming traffic — $100  
- Driving without licence plates or a valid licence disc — $250  
- Parking on sidewalks — $80

## Why It Matters
The penalties set out in the Road Traffic Act are not just about collecting fines. They are meant to discourage dangerous behaviour and protect everyone who uses the road.
