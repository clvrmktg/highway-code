## Seatbelts & Child Restraints

Seatbelts save lives. The law requires that drivers and passengers use them where fitted, and that children are properly secured. These rules are among the most strictly enforced and are frequently tested in the exam.

## Seatbelt Requirements
- The **driver and all front-seat passengers** must wear a seatbelt where one is fitted {{< footnote id="1" >}}.  
- Rear passengers should also wear seatbelts if they are fitted {{< footnote id="2" >}}.  
- Exemptions may apply for medical reasons, but only if a valid certificate is carried.  

Failure to wear a seatbelt is a **fixed penalty offence** {{< footnote id="3" >}}.

## Child Restraints
Children must travel in the **correct type of restraint for their age, height, or weight** {{< footnote id="2" >}}:  

- **Infants (under 1 year or under 20 lbs.):** rear-facing child seat.  
- **Toddlers (1–4 years, 20–40 lbs.):** forward-facing child seat with harness.  
- **Young children (4–7 years, 40–80 lbs.):** booster seat with seatbelt.  
- **Older children (7–12 years):** should use seatbelts, ideally with booster cushions if too small for adult belts.  

It is illegal to carry a child **unrestrained on your lap** or in a vehicle without proper restraint.

## Penalties
Not wearing a seatbelt or failing to secure a child properly can result in:  
- A **fixed penalty ticket** (fine) {{< footnote id="3" >}}  
- Possible demerit points added to the driver’s licence if responsible  

➡ See [Penalties & Offences](/law/penalties-offences/) for details on fines and points.

## Why It Matters
Seatbelts reduce the risk of death or serious injury in a crash by more than 40%. Proper child restraints cut the risk even further. These laws are not just about compliance — they are about keeping everyone safe.
