## Franchises & Public Service Vehicles
In addition to a driver's licence, each taxi, livery car, omnibus, or tour car must also have a valid **franchise** issued by the Road Traffic Authority. {{< footnote id="1" >}}

**Key points**
- A franchise licences the **vehicle**, while the Public Service Driver's Licence qualifies the **driver**.  
- Each public service vehicle must display the appropriate licence plates and markings (e.g., taxi plates).  
- Franchises are limited in number and can only be issued, transferred, or cancelled by the Road Traffic Authority.  
- The vehicle must be licensed, insured, and inspected like any other motor vehicle.  
- Operating a public service vehicle without a franchise is an offence.  

**Fees**  
Franchise fees are payable annually along with vehicle licensing. Amounts vary depending on the vehicle category.  

➡ See [Public Service Driver's Licence](#public-service-drivers-licence) above for the driver qualification requirements.  

{{< callout type="tip" title="Study Tip" >}}
Remember: a **driver's licence** qualifies the person, but a **franchise** licences the vehicle. Both are required for public service operation.
