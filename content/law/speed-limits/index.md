## Speed Limit

Speed limits are in place to keep drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. The Road Traffic Act sets a **default limit** and allows the Minister to set different limits for certain roads or vehicle types.

## Default Speed Limit
Unless otherwise posted, the **default speed limit** in The Bahamas is **30 miles per hour** {{< footnote id="1" >}}.  

This applies to all roads unless a different limit is prescribed by regulations or displayed on road signs.

---

## Special Speed Limits
The Minister may set different limits for:  
- Certain **roads or classes of roads** (e.g., highways, school zones)  
- Certain **classes of vehicles** (e.g., heavy trucks, public service vehicles)  

These limits must be clearly indicated by **road signs**. Always obey posted signs, as they override the default 30 mph rule.

---

## Enforcement
Speeding offences are proven by:  
- Measuring **distance and time**  
- Police **speedometer or radar** readings  

Convictions cannot be based solely on one person’s opinion of speed {{< footnote id="1" >}}.  

---

## Penalties
If convicted of speeding, penalties include:  
- **First offence:** $250–$500 fine  
- **Second offence:** $500–$1,000 fine  
- **Third or subsequent offence:** disqualification from holding a licence for up to 12 months {{< footnote id="1" >}}  

➡ See [Penalties & Offences](/law/penalties-offences/) for details on fines, disqualification, and demerit points.

## Why It Matters
Driving too fast reduces reaction time, increases stopping distance, and makes collisions more severe. Respecting speed limits protects you and other road users.
