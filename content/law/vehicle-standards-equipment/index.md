# Vehicle Standards & Equipment

All vehicles on Bahamian roads must meet minimum safety standards. These requirements are set out in the Road Traffic Act to ensure that every vehicle is safe to operate and does not pose a danger to other road users.

## Lighting & Visibility
Every vehicle **must** have working lights and reflectors:  
- Headlamps that can be dimmed when approaching other traffic  
- Rear lamps visible at night  
- Brake lights and stop lamps  
- Working turn signals  

Drivers **must** dip headlights at least 300 yards from oncoming vehicles at night.

---

## Mirrors, Horns & Safety Features
All vehicles **must** be fitted with:  
- A mirror that gives the driver a clear view to the rear  
- A horn or warning device in good working order  
- Windshield wipers (for vehicles with windscreens)  

---

## Tyres & Mechanical Condition
Vehicles **must** be kept in good mechanical condition {{< footnote id="1" >}}:  
- Brakes and steering in proper working order  
- Tyres with sufficient tread, free from dangerous defects  
- Exhaust systems in safe condition, without excessive noise, smoke, or vibration  

Police may stop a vehicle and order repairs if defects are found. Failure to comply is an offence and carries an $80 fine {{< footnote id="2" >}}.  

Courts may suspend or cancel a driver’s licence following conviction for defective condition or equipment offences {{< footnote id="3" >}}.  

---

## Loads
If carrying a load that extends more than **4 feet** beyond the rear of the vehicle, the driver **must**:  
- Display a **red flag** during the day  
- Display a **red light** at night {{< footnote id="4" >}}  

Loads must be properly secured so they cannot fall or shift dangerously.

---

## Prohibited Modifications
Drivers **must not** operate vehicles with alterations that make them unsafe or non-compliant with the Act, such as:  
- Removing silencers from exhausts  
- Fitting unsafe tyres  
- Modifying lights or signals so they are misleading  

---

## Why It Matters
These standards exist to keep vehicles roadworthy and safe for everyone. Driving a defective or improperly equipped vehicle is not only unsafe — it is against the law and may result in fines, penalties, or removal of the vehicle from the road.
