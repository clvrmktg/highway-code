## Rules of the Road

The road belongs to everyone — drivers, riders, cyclists, and pedestrians. To share it safely, The Bahamas has clear rules set out in the **Road Traffic Act (Ch. 220)** and explained in the **Bahamas Highway Code**.  

This section brings the two together: the legal requirements you **must** follow and the practical guidance you **should** follow to drive safely and pass your exam.

## How the Rules Work

- **"Must" = the law.**  
  Breaking a rule marked **must** is an offence. Penalties range from fixed fines to licence suspension, vehicle impoundment, or imprisonment. For example, driving without insurance (s.8) carries fines, prison time, and a mandatory 12-month licence suspension.  

- **"Should" = best practice.**  
  These are guidance rules from the Highway Code. Ignoring them isn't an offence by itself, but if you cause an accident, you can still be prosecuted for careless or dangerous driving. Courts may use the Code to decide if you were at fault.

## Why They Matter

- **Safety first.** Most road crashes in The Bahamas involve speed, careless overtaking, or poor judgment at junctions. Following the rules reduces risk for everyone.  
- **Legal protection.** Obeying the Act protects you from penalties and ensures you are insured if an accident happens.  
- **Exam success.** The driving test draws heavily from these rules. Expect questions where you must choose when to stop, when to give way, or what you must carry with you.
