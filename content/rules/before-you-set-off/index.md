## Legal Essentials

These are the things you **must** do — they are required by law.

- **Valid driver's licence**  
  Visitors may drive on a valid foreign licence. An International Driving Permit (**IDP**) is recommended if the licence is not in English.  

- **Valid vehicle licence & inspection**  
  Vehicles must be registered, licensed, and inspected.  

- **Motor insurance in force**  
  Driving without insurance is an offence.  

- **New in 2025**  
  Police may **impound** an uninsured or unlicensed vehicle until documents are produced and a $300 release fee is paid.  

➡ For full details, see [Insurance & Documents](/law/insurance-documents/).  

{{< callout type="warning" title="If you can't prove it, don't drive it." >}}
Expired, missing, or unproducible documents can lead to fines, licence suspension, or vehicle impoundment.
