## Emergency Vehicles & School Zones

Sirens, flashing lights, and school crossings demand an immediate and safe response. You **must** give way to emergency vehicles and **must** obey rules in school zones to protect children and vulnerable pedestrians.

## Good Practice

### Emergency Vehicles
- **Pull over safely:** Move to the left-hand side of the road and stop if possible.  
- **At roundabouts or junctions:** Do not stop in the intersection. Leave it first, then pull over. See [Roundabouts](/rules/roundabouts/).  
- **In traffic queues:** Stay in your lane and create a clear path; do not mount kerbs or drive through red lights unless directed.  
- **At roadworks:** Follow flagger or police instructions. See [Roadworks & Closures](/rules/special-conditions/roadworks-closures/).  

### School Zones
- **Slow down:** Observe posted school-zone speed limits (often reduced during school hours).  
- **Crossing guards:** Stop when signalled and remain stopped until children and guards are clear.{{< footnote id="2" >}}  
- **Extra care:** Watch for children running into the road unexpectedly.  
- **No overtaking:** Never overtake another vehicle in a school zone.

## Special Considerations

- **Multiple emergency vehicles:** Wait until all have passed before moving off.  
- **False alarms or convoys:** Treat all sirens and lights as genuine until clear.  
- **School buses:** When school buses stop to load/unload, you should slow or stop as necessary and be alert for crossing children.
