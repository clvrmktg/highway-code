## Junctions

Junctions are where two or more roads meet. Crashes often happen here because drivers fail to give way, misjudge another vehicle’s speed, or block the intersection.  

Approach every junction with extra caution: slow down, position your vehicle correctly, and signal early so others know what you intend to do.  

➡ Offences at junctions — such as failing to stop, blocking, or careless entry — can lead to fines or demerit points. See [Penalties & Offences](/law/penalties-offences/) for details.

## Legal Essentials

These are rules you **must** follow under the law:

- **STOP signs:** You must come to a complete stop at a STOP sign and only proceed when the way is clear. Rolling through is illegal {{< footnote id="1" >}}.  
- **YIELD (Give Way) signs:** You must slow and give way to traffic on the major road. Proceed only when it is safe {{< footnote id="1" >}}.  
- **Uncontrolled junctions:** If there are no signs or signals, give way to traffic approaching from your right {{< footnote id="1" >}}.  
- **Priority roads:** Where markings or signs give another road priority, you must follow them.  
- **Do not block a junction:** Enter only if your exit is clear — even if the light is green {{< footnote id="2" >}}.  

Breaking these rules may be prosecuted as careless or dangerous driving {{< footnote id="3" >}}.

## Safe Approach to Junctions

These are steps you **should** take at every junction:

- **Slow down and prepare to stop.**  
- **Check mirrors** and watch for cyclists, motorcyclists, and pedestrians.  
- **Lane discipline:** At many junctions, markings or arrows show which lane to use. Get into the correct lane in good time and do not change lanes without reason.  
- **Signal clearly** well before you turn.  
- **Position your vehicle** correctly:  
  - Turning left: keep left.  
  - Turning right: position close to the centre line.  
- **Look both ways** before moving out, even if you have priority.  
- **Queues:** If traffic is stopped ahead, join the back of the queue. Do not try to cut in or push past other vehicles.

## Turning at Junctions

- **Turning left:** Signal left early, keep to the left side, and watch for pedestrians crossing.  
- **Turning right:** Signal right, position near the centre line, and give way to oncoming traffic before turning.  
- **Crossing traffic:** If you must cross the path of other vehicles, do so quickly and safely without forcing others to slow down.  

---

## Special Considerations

- **T-junctions:** Traffic on the continuing road has priority.  
- **Pedestrians:** Always give way to pedestrians crossing at or near a junction.  
- **Large vehicles:** Be aware that buses and trucks may need extra room to turn.

## Frequently Asked Questions

{{< callout type="tip" title="Study Tip" >}}
- Learn the difference between **STOP** and **YIELD**. (You must stop completely at STOP; at YIELD you only stop if necessary.)  
- Expect questions like: *“Who has priority at an uncontrolled junction?”* → traffic from the **right**.  
- Remember: blocking a junction, even on a green light, is an offence.
