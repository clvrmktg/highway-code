# FAQs

question = "Which side of the road must you drive on in The Bahamas?"
answer = "You must always keep to the left-hand side of the road, except when overtaking or when directed otherwise."

[[faqs.items]]
question = "Can I stay in the right-hand lane if traffic is light?"
answer = "No. On multi-lane roads, you should keep to the left unless overtaking or preparing to turn right. Cruising in the right lane without reason can cause obstruction."

[[faqs.items]]
question = "When should I change lanes?"
answer = "You should change lanes only when necessary — for overtaking, turning, or following lane markings. Always signal first, check mirrors and blind spots, and only move when it is safe."

[[faqs.items]]
question = "What do solid and broken lane lines mean?"
answer = "A solid line means you must not cross or straddle it. A broken line means you may change lanes if the road is clear and it is safe to do so."

[[faqs.items]]
question = "Can I cut into a queue of traffic at a junction?"
answer = "No. You must join the back of the queue and wait your turn. Cutting in causes obstruction and is inconsiderate driving."

# Lane Discipline

Staying in the correct lane and moving between lanes safely is essential for smooth and safe traffic flow. Poor lane discipline leads to crashes, traffic jams, and frustration for other drivers.  

➡ Careless lane changes and blocking traffic may lead to penalties. See [Penalties & Offences](/law/penalties-offences/) for details.

## Legal Essentials

You **must** follow the law when using lanes:  

- You **must not** drive without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for others {{< footnote id="1" >}}.  
- You **must not** cause an obstruction by blocking a lane, refusing to give way, or stopping where you hinder traffic {{< footnote id="2" >}}.  
- You **must** obey lane arrows, markings, and instructions from police or traffic wardens {{< footnote id="3" >}}.

## Good Practice

These are steps you **should** take to maintain safe lane discipline:  

- **Keep left:** In The Bahamas, always drive on the left-hand side of the road unless overtaking.  
- **Use lanes properly:** Only use a lane for its marked direction (e.g., left-turn only, straight ahead).  
- **Plan early:** Move into the correct lane in good time when approaching junctions, roundabouts, or exits.  
- **Signal clearly:** Always signal before changing lanes or turning.  
- **Check mirrors and blind spots:** Make sure it is safe before moving sideways.  
- **Stay steady:** Avoid weaving between lanes or sudden lane changes.

## Special Considerations

- **Multi-lane roads:** Keep left unless overtaking or turning right. Do not cruise in the right-hand lane.  
- **Road markings:** Solid lines mean you must not cross. Broken lines mean you may change lanes when it is safe.  
- **Bus lanes:** If marked, these are reserved for buses (and sometimes taxis) during operating hours.  
- **Stopped traffic:** Join the back of queues. Do not cut in or straddle lanes to get ahead.
