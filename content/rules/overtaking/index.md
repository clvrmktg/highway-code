# Overtaking

Overtaking carries a high risk and must be done with extreme care. Many serious crashes in The Bahamas are caused by overtaking at the wrong time or place. If in doubt, do not attempt it.  

➡ Dangerous or careless overtaking can lead to penalties. See [Penalties & Offences](/law/penalties-offences/) for details.

## Legal Essentials

These are rules you **must** follow — breaking them is an offence:

- You **must not** overtake dangerously — doing so can amount to *dangerous driving* {{< footnote id="1" >}} or *careless driving* {{< footnote id="2" >}}.  
- You **must not** overtake:  
  - on a bend or hill where you cannot see far ahead {{< footnote id="3" >}}  
  - at or near a junction {{< footnote id="3" >}}  
  - at or near a pedestrian crossing {{< footnote id="3" >}}  
  - where signs or road markings prohibit it {{< footnote id="3" >}}  
- You **must** normally overtake on the **right**. The only exception: if the vehicle ahead is turning right and it is safe to pass on the left {{< footnote id="4" >}}.  
- You **must not** exceed the speed limit in order to overtake.

## Road Markings and Overtaking

In The Bahamas, centreline markings are usually **white**, not yellow. These lines guide when you may or may not overtake:

- **Single broken white line** (most two-way roads): You may overtake if the road ahead is clear.  
- **Single solid white line** (curves, hills, bridges, or poor visibility): You must not cross to overtake, unless it is safe and necessary (e.g., passing a stationary obstruction).  
- **Double solid white lines** (busy roads or approaching hazards): You must not cross or straddle from either direction.  
- **Solid yellow line (left edge):** Found on divided highways; marks the boundary of the roadway, not used for overtaking rules.  
- **Pedestrian crossings (striped or zig-zag approaches):** You must never overtake at or near a crossing {{< footnote id="3" >}}.

## Overtaking a Stopped Vehicle

If the vehicle ahead has stopped, try to check why:  
- They may be letting a pedestrian cross.  
- There may be an obstruction you cannot see.  
- A driver or passenger may suddenly open a door.  

Approach with caution before overtaking a stopped vehicle {{< footnote id="3" >}}.

## Safe Overtaking Procedure

These are steps you **should** follow to keep overtaking safe:

1. **Check mirrors** — know what is behind and to the side.  
2. **Look ahead** — is the road long enough and clear?  
3. **Signal right** in good time.  
4. **Move out smoothly** and accelerate past the vehicle.  
5. **Leave plenty of room** — especially for cyclists or motorcyclists.  
6. **Return to the left lane** only when you can see the overtaken vehicle in your mirror.  

{{< callout type="warning" title="Don't Rely on Others' Signals" >}}
If the driver ahead signals that the road is clear to overtake, **do not assume they are right**.  
Make your own judgement and only overtake if you can see that it is safe.  
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="warning" title="If the Other Driver Speeds Up" >}}
If a driver you are overtaking speeds up or resists in any way, **stop trying to overtake**.  
Never get into a race with another driver.

## If You Are Being Overtaken

- Keep a steady course and **do not speed up**.  
- Move slightly left if safe, giving the other driver room.  
- Slow gently if needed to let them pass quickly.

{{< callout type="tip" title="Study Tip" >}}
- Expect questions like: *“Where must you not overtake?”* → bends, hills, junctions, pedestrian crossings, and solid/double white lines.  
- Know the exceptions: you may pass on the left **only** if the vehicle ahead is turning right and there is room to do so safely.  
- Be ready for trick questions about overtaking stopped vehicles or relying on another driver's signal.
