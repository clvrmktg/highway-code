# Parking & Waiting

Where and how you stop your vehicle matters. Poor or illegal parking causes danger, blocks traffic, and can lead to fines or your vehicle being removed.  

➡ For penalties and fines, see [Penalties & Offences](/law/penalties-offences/).

## Legal Essentials

These are rules you **must** follow under the law:

- You **must not** park on a pedestrian crossing, junction, roundabout, or anywhere your vehicle obstructs other traffic {{< footnote id="1" >}}.  
- You **must not** park where “No Parking” signs or road markings prohibit it {{< footnote id="1" >}}.  
- You **must not** park on a sidewalk, verge, or in front of a driveway where you block access.  
- You **must** switch off the engine, set the handbrake, and remove the key if leaving the vehicle unattended.  
- If your vehicle is unlicensed or uninsured and left on a public road, police may **impound** it until valid documents and a release fee are provided {{< footnote id="2" >}}.  

---

## Good Practice

These are things you **should** do when parking or waiting:

- Park close to the kerb, facing the same direction as traffic.  
- Leave enough space for other vehicles to pass, especially near bends or narrow roads.  
- Avoid parking opposite driveways, near school gates, or in bus bays.  
- If you must stop briefly, use hazard lights to warn others.  
- At night on unlit roads, leave sidelights on if parked on the main carriageway.  

---

## Special Considerations

- **Yellow kerb lines:** A single yellow line may indicate no waiting during certain hours. A double yellow means no waiting at any time. Always check nearby signs.  
- **Disabled parking bays:** Reserved for vehicles displaying a valid permit.  
- **Emergency access:** Never stop where you block fire hydrants, entrances to hospitals, or other emergency facilities.
