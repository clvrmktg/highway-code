# Reversing

Reversing should only be done when necessary, and always with care. Most vehicles have restricted vision when reversing, so you **must** take extra precautions to avoid collisions with other vehicles, pedestrians, or objects.  

➡ Careless reversing that endangers others can lead to penalties. See [Penalties & Offences](/law/penalties-offences/) for details.

## Good Practice

These are steps you **should** take when reversing:

- **Check all around**: Use mirrors, but also turn and look over your shoulder to see blind spots.  
- **Go slowly**: Keep speed to a crawl so you can stop immediately if needed.  
- **Use a helper**: If your view is restricted, ask someone to guide you.  
- **Sound horn lightly** if necessary to warn others of your movement.  
- **Be aware of pedestrians** — especially children, who may be hidden behind the vehicle.  
- **Reverse into parking spaces** where practical, so you can drive out forwards.

## Special Considerations

- In busy streets, you **should** avoid reversing onto main roads or across pedestrian walkways.  
- When reversing near schools, parks, or residential areas, take extra care as children may suddenly appear behind your vehicle.  
- Large vehicles and trucks should use spotters whenever possible.
