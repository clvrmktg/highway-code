question = "Which lane should I use at a roundabout?"

question = "When should I signal at a roundabout?"
answer = "Signal **left** on approach if turning left. For straight ahead, signal left after passing the exit before yours. For right turns or a full circle, signal **right** on approach, then left after passing the exit before yours."

question = "Can large vehicles use more than one lane at a roundabout?"

question = "What should I do if an emergency vehicle approaches while I'm on a roundabout?"
answer = "Do not stop on the roundabout. Exit at the next opportunity, then pull over safely and let the emergency vehicle pass. See also: [Emergency Vehicles & School Zones](/rules/emergency-vehicles-school-zones/)."

## Roundabouts

Roundabouts keep traffic moving, but they only work if everyone follows the rules. In The Bahamas, traffic circulates **clockwise**. You drive on the left and **must** give way to traffic already on the roundabout coming from your right.{{< footnote id="1" >}}

## Legal Essentials

- You must give way to traffic on your right when entering a roundabout.{{< footnote id="1" >}}  
- You must not enter unless your path is clear. Blocking a roundabout causes obstruction.{{< footnote id="3" >}}  
- You must not change lanes carelessly or without signalling.{{< footnote id="3" >}}  
- Careless or inconsiderate driving at a roundabout may be prosecuted.{{< footnote id="2" >}}

## Approaching a Roundabout

- **Slow down** and be prepared to stop.  
- **Check mirrors** and decide early which lane you need. See [Lane Discipline](/rules/lane-discipline/).  
- **Signal clearly**:  
  - **Turning left:** Signal left on approach.  
  - **Going straight ahead:** No signal on approach. Signal left after passing the exit before yours.  
  - **Turning right or full circle:** Signal right on approach. Signal left after passing the exit before yours.  

---

## Using the Roundabout

- **Keep in lane** and do not weave.  
- **Use the left lane** for left turns or straight ahead (unless signs or markings show otherwise).  
- **Use the right lane** if turning right or going full circle.  
- **Watch for cyclists and motorcyclists** — they may stay in the left lane even when turning right.  
- **Look out for pedestrians** at crossings near the exits.  

---

## Special Considerations

- **Large vehicles** may need more than one lane. Give them room.  
- **Emergency vehicles:** If sirens or flashing lights approach, do not stop on the roundabout. Leave at the next exit and let them pass. See [Emergency Vehicles & School Zones](/rules/emergency-vehicles-school-zones/).  
- **Blocked exits:** Never enter unless you can clear the roundabout without stopping. See [Junctions](/rules/junctions/).

## Frequently Asked Questions

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
- You must know: always give way to the right.  
- You must signal correctly: left on approach for left turns, right on approach for right turns or full circle, and left after passing the exit before yours.  
- Expect trick questions about lane choice — always follow arrows and markings. See [Lane Discipline](/rules/lane-discipline/).
