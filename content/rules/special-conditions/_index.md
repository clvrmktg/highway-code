## Special Conditions

Most driving takes place in normal daylight and fair weather. But sometimes you face unusual or high-risk conditions. The Highway Code explains how you **must** adapt your driving for safety.  

Crashes in The Bahamas often happen in poor visibility, on fast divided highways, or when drivers ignore temporary signals. These rules help you stay safe ‚Äî and they appear often in the theory and practical exams.

## What You'll Learn in This Section

- [Low Visibility](/rules/special-conditions/low-visibility/) ‚Üí You **must** use headlights between sunset and sunrise, and when visibility is poor.  
- [Dual Carriageways](/rules/special-conditions/dual-carriageways/) ‚Üí You **must** keep left unless overtaking, and follow entry/exit signs carefully.  
- [Hills & Narrow Roads](/rules/special-conditions/hills-narrow-roads/) ‚Üí You **must** give way where the road narrows and use engine braking on steep descents.  
- [Roadworks & Closures](/rules/special-conditions/roadworks-closures/) ‚Üí You **must** obey cones, flaggers, and temporary traffic signals.

## Why It Matters

- **Visibility:** Most fatal head-on collisions in fog or rain happen because drivers failed to slow down or use lights correctly.  
- **High-speed roads:** Divided highways demand strict lane discipline. See also [Lane Discipline](/rules/lane-discipline/).  
- **Steep and narrow roads:** Meeting on hills requires judgement and courtesy. A wrong move can cause a collision or force others off the road.  
- **Temporary control:** Ignoring flaggers or cones at roadworks is an offence and endangers workers. See also [Emergency Vehicles & School Zones](/rules/emergency-vehicles-school-zones/).

{{< callout type="tip" >}}
On the exam, questions about **special conditions** often ask: *‚ÄúWhat must you do?‚Äù* in poor visibility, steep hills, or temporary traffic control.  
üëâ Always choose the answer with the clear **must** rule (lights, give way, obey signals).
