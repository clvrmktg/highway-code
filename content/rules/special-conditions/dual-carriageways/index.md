question = "Why is lane discipline more important on dual carriageways?"
answer = "Because higher speeds mean less time to react. Staying in the correct lane and signalling early prevents dangerous collisions. See [Lane Discipline](/rules/lane-discipline/)."

## Dual Carriageways

A **dual carriageway** (divided highway) has a physical barrier or median separating traffic moving in opposite directions. In The Bahamas, these are found mainly in New Providence and on some Family Island routes. They allow faster traffic flow but come with strict rules for safety.

## Legal Essentials

- You **must** keep to the left lane unless overtaking or preparing to turn right.{{< footnote id="2" >}}  
- You **must not** reverse, make a U-turn, or cross the central reservation (median).{{< footnote id="2" >}}  
- You **must not** stop on the carriageway, except in an emergency or where directed by police.{{< footnote id="2" >}}  
- Careless or inconsiderate driving — such as lane hogging, tailgating, or unsafe overtaking — may be prosecuted.{{< footnote id="1" >}}

## Good Practice

- **Plan ahead:** Enter and exit using slip roads or junctions. Do not cut across traffic.  
- **Use the left lane for normal driving:** The right lane is for overtaking or right turns only. See [Lane Discipline](/rules/lane-discipline/).  
- **Check speed:** Dual carriageways may have higher limits, but you must not exceed the posted speed limit. See [Speed](/rules/speed/).  
- **Keep distance:** Leave extra space at higher speeds — at least a 2–3 second gap in dry weather, doubled in rain.  
- **Use signals early:** Indicate in plenty of time before changing lanes or exiting.

## Special Considerations

- **Breakdowns:** If your vehicle breaks down, pull fully onto the shoulder if available, switch on hazard lights, and call for assistance. See [Emergencies → Breakdowns](/emergencies/breakdowns/).  
- **Pedestrians and animals:** Dual carriageways are not for walking or herding animals. If you encounter either, slow down and be prepared to stop. See [Vulnerable Users](/rules/vulnerable-users/).  
- **Weather:** Heavy rain can cause spray and aquaplaning at high speed. See [Low Visibility](/rules/special-conditions/low-visibility/#rain-fog/).

## Exam Pointers

- *Which lane must you use for normal driving?* → The left-hand lane.  
- *When may you use the right-hand lane?* → Only for overtaking or turning right.  
- *Is it legal to reverse or make a U-turn on a dual carriageway?* → No, it is prohibited.  
- *Where may you stop?* → Only in an emergency or if directed by police.

{{< callout type="tip" title="Study Tip" >}}
- You must remember: **left lane = normal driving; right lane = overtaking only**.  
- Examiners often test trick questions about U-turns and stopping — the correct answer is always “only in an emergency.”  
- Cross-reference with [Lane Discipline](/rules/lane-discipline/) and [Speed](/rules/speed/) for full exam prep.
