question = "How should I drive downhill safely?"

question = "What should I do if the road is too narrow for me and another vehicle?"
answer = "Slow down, be ready to stop, and pull into a passing place if available. Do not force the other driver to reverse unless it is safer for them."

[[faqs.items]]
question = "Why is coasting downhill dangerous?"
answer = "Because you lose engine braking, making it harder to control speed and putting all the strain on your brakes."

question = "What if I meet a large vehicle on a hill?"
answer = "Slow down, keep left, and be prepared to stop. Large vehicles may need extra space or have difficulty restarting uphill. See also [Overtaking](/rules/overtaking/)."

## Hills & Narrow Roads

Driving on steep gradients or tight, narrow roads demands special care. You **must** be ready to slow, stop, or give way, and you **should** use proper gear control to stay safe.

## Legal Essentials

- You **must** give way where the road is too narrow for two vehicles to pass.{{< footnote id="1" >}}  
- You **must** obey any priority signs showing which side of the road must give way.{{< footnote id="1" >}}  
- Careless or inconsiderate driving on a hill or narrow road — such as refusing to yield or forcing others to reverse — may be prosecuted.{{< footnote id="2" >}}

## Good Practice

- **Use low gear on descents:** You **should** use engine braking by selecting a low gear before going downhill. This prevents brake fade and keeps control.{{< footnote id="3" >}}  
- **Do not coast:** Never roll downhill in neutral or with the clutch pressed. You lose control of speed and braking.  
- **Approaching a narrow section:** Slow down, be prepared to stop, and look ahead for oncoming vehicles.  
- **Pull into passing places:** If the road is single-track or too narrow, use a lay-by, pull-off, or wider spot to let others pass.  
- **Use mirrors:** Check behind you — smaller vehicles or motorcycles may need to pass.  
- **Signal intentions:** Use signals or hand gestures to show courtesy when yielding.

## Special Considerations

- **Large vehicles:** Trucks and buses climbing hills may be slow — be patient, do not tailgate, and overtake only if safe. See [Overtaking](/rules/overtaking/).  
- **Visibility:** Many hills have blind crests or bends. Keep left and do not overtake until you can see the road ahead.  
- **Reversing on hills:** If you must reverse, do so with great care and use a helper if available. See [Reversing](/rules/reversing/).  
- **Slippery conditions:** Rain or loose gravel on slopes can cause skids — reduce speed and brake gently. See [Low Visibility](/rules/special-conditions/low-visibility/#rain-fog).

## Exam Pointers

- *When must you give way on a narrow road?* → When signs indicate or when the road is too narrow for two vehicles to pass.{{< footnote id="1" >}}  
- *How should you control speed on steep descents?* → Use a low gear and engine braking, not just the footbrake.{{< footnote id="3" >}}  
- *Is it safe to coast downhill in neutral?* → No, it is dangerous and prohibited.  
- *What should you do if another vehicle cannot pass you on a narrow road?* → Pull into a passing place or safe spot and let them by.

{{< callout type="tip" title="Study Tip" >}}
- Remember: **low gear downhill, no coasting** — this is a common exam trap.  
- Always think *who can stop more easily* on a narrow road. Examiners often ask about giving way on hills or single-lane roads.  
- Cross-link with [Overtaking](/rules/overtaking/) and [Reversing](/rules/reversing/) for related scenarios.
