## Low Visibility

Driving at night or in poor weather is more dangerous because visibility is reduced and roads may be slippery. You **must** take extra care, adjust your speed, and keep your lights and windows in proper working order.

## Legal Essentials

- You **must** use headlights between sunset and sunrise, and whenever visibility is reduced by rain, fog, or other conditions.{{< footnote id="1" >}}  
- You **must** dip headlights when approaching another road user or when following a vehicle closely.{{< footnote id="2" >}}  
- You **must** keep your windscreen, windows, and mirrors clear. Driving with restricted vision can be prosecuted as careless driving.{{< footnote id="4" >}}  
- You **must** not use fog lights unless visibility is seriously reduced. Using them in clear conditions can dazzle other drivers.{{< footnote id="3" >}}

## Good Practice

These are steps you **should** take to stay safe.  

### Night Driving {#night}
- **Use full beam wisely:** On unlit roads at night, use full beam when safe. Dip headlights when another vehicle is near.  
- **Avoid glare:** If dazzled by oncoming headlights, look slightly to the left edge of the road until your eyes adjust.  
- **See and be seen:** Keep all lights clean and working. Pedestrians, cyclists, and animals are harder to spot after dark. See also [Vulnerable Users](/rules/vulnerable-users/).  
- **Fatigue:** Driving tired is dangerous. Stop and rest if you feel drowsy.  

### Rain and Fog {#rain-fog}
- **Increase following distance:** Double the gap you normally leave in rain or on wet roads. See [Speed](/rules/speed/).  
- **Reduce speed:** Drive more slowly and smoothly. Avoid harsh braking or acceleration.  
- **Keep windows clear:** Use wipers, demisters, and air conditioning to prevent misting.  
- **Aquaplaning:** If tyres lose contact with the road in heavy rain, ease off the accelerator and avoid sudden braking.  
- **After water:** If you drive through deep water, press the brakes lightly afterwards to dry them.  
- **Fog:** Use low beam or fog lights (if fitted), not high beam — full beam reflects off fog and makes visibility worse.

## Special Considerations

- In severe storms or hurricanes, you **must** follow police instructions and avoid unnecessary travel.  
- On poorly lit Family Island roads, animals may be on the carriageway. Slow down and use high beam when safe. See [Animals](/rules/vulnerable-users/animals/).  
- In heavy rain, roadside flooding may hide potholes or debris — pass through slowly and with care.  
- **Dusk and dawn:** Even before sunset or sunrise, light may be poor. Switch headlights on early to ensure you are seen.  
- **Sun glare:** Low sun can dazzle. Keep your windscreen clean, use visors, and wear sunglasses if necessary.  
- **Smoke, dust, or haze:** During brush fires, construction, or Sahara dust haze, visibility can drop sharply. Slow down and use dipped headlights so other drivers can see you.

## Exam Pointers

- *When must you use headlights?* → Between sunset and sunrise, and when visibility is poor.  
- *When must you dip headlights?* → When approaching oncoming traffic or following another vehicle closely.  
- *When can you use fog lights?* → Only when visibility is seriously reduced.  
- *How should you drive in heavy rain or fog?* → Slow down, increase following distance, and keep windows clear.  
- *What should you do if you start aquaplaning?* → Ease off the accelerator and avoid sudden braking.
