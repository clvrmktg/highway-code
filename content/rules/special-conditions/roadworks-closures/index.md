# Roadworks and Closures

Roadworks and temporary closures help maintain and improve the roads, but they also create hazards. You **must** slow down, follow the signs, and obey any directions from flaggers, cones, or temporary signals.

## Legal Essentials

- You **must** obey temporary traffic lights, cones, barriers, and flaggers.{{< footnote id="2" >}}  
- You **must** follow instructions from police or road workers controlling traffic.{{< footnote id="2" >}}  
- You **must not** drive carelessly or without consideration — ignoring temporary control is an offence.{{< footnote id="1" >}}  

---

## Good Practice

- **Slow down:** Road surfaces may be uneven, narrow, or slippery.  
- **Watch for workers:** Always be alert for road workers close to traffic.  
- **Keep distance:** Maintain safe space between you and the vehicle in front — sudden stops are common in work zones.  
- **Follow signs early:** Lane closures and diversions are signposted in advance. Plan your move into the correct lane in good time. See [Lane Discipline](/rules/lane-discipline/).  
- **Be patient:** Delays are common. Aggressive driving in work zones puts lives at risk.  

---

## Special Considerations

- **Flaggers:** Treat instructions from a flagger with the same authority as a police officer.  
- **Temporary signals:** Obey red lights even if the road looks clear — the other side may have priority.  
- **Closures:** If a road is fully closed, you must follow the marked diversion route. Do not drive past “ROAD CLOSED” signs.  
- **Emergency vehicles:** If sirens or flashing lights appear in a work zone, follow flagger or police guidance. See [Emergency Vehicles & School Zones](/rules/emergency-vehicles-school-zones/).

## Exam Pointers

- *Who has authority at roadworks?* → Flaggers, temporary signals, cones, and police all carry authority.  
- *What must you do when approaching roadworks?* → Slow down, follow signs, and be ready to stop.  
- *Is it legal to ignore a “ROAD CLOSED” sign if the road looks passable?* → No. You must follow the diversion.
