# FAQs
[[faqs.items]]
question = "Does The Bahamas have speed limits?"
answer = "Yes. The law sets national limits: **25 mph** in Nassau and settlements, **30 mph** outside city limits where not otherwise posted, and **45 mph** outside settlements unless signs say otherwise."

[[faqs.items]]
question = "What is the speed limit in Nassau?"
answer = "The speed limit is **25 mph** within Nassau city limits."

[[faqs.items]]
question = "What is the speed limit in Family Island settlements?"
answer = "The limit is **25 mph** within any settlement."

[[faqs.items]]
question = "What is the general speed limit outside settlements?"
answer = "The default is **45 mph**, unless a different limit is posted."

[[faqs.items]]
question = "Can you go over 10% of the speed limit?"
answer = "No. Legally you cannot exceed the limit at all — not 10%, not 5 mph, not even 0.05 mph. In practice, some enforcement equipment may only measure whole mph, but the law does not allow any tolerance."

[[faqs.items]]
question = "Can you be penalized even if you stay under the limit?"
answer = "Yes. If your speed is unsafe for the conditions (for example, driving too fast in rain, fog, or near schools), you may be guilty of dangerous or careless driving, even within the limit."

# Speed

Keeping to the speed limit is not just about obeying the law — it is about safety. Driving too fast is one of the leading causes of crashes in The Bahamas {{< footnote id="2" >}}.

## Legal Essentials

These are things you **must** follow under the law:

- **Default limits:**  
  - **25 mph** within Nassau city limits and Family Island settlements {{< footnote id="2" >}}  
  - **30 mph** outside city limits where not otherwise posted {{< footnote id="2" >}}  
  - **45 mph** outside settlements unless signs indicate otherwise {{< footnote id="2" >}}  

- **Special limits:** The Minister may prescribe lower or higher limits for specific roads or vehicles {{< footnote id="1" >}}. Always follow posted signs.  

- **Penalties for speeding:**  
  - **First offence:** $250–$500 fine  
  - **Second offence:** $500–$1,000 fine  
  - **Third offence:** Possible disqualification up to 12 months {{< footnote id="3" >}}

## Driving to Conditions

Even when you are **within the limit**, you **must** slow down in these situations:  

- Approaching bends, junctions, pedestrian crossings, or busy markets  
- On wet or unsealed (dirt) roads  
- At night or in fog/rain where visibility is reduced  
- Near schools, bus stops, or crowds of pedestrians {{< footnote id="4" >}}  

Remember: if you **double your speed**, your stopping distance **more than triples**.  

---

## Safe Following Distance

The Highway Code advises:  
- Leave at least **2 seconds** between you and the vehicle in front on dry roads.  
- In rain or poor conditions, **double this gap**.  
- Large vehicles need even more space to stop safely {{< footnote id="4" >}}.  

---

## Exam Pointers

{{< callout type="tip" title="Study Tip" >}}
- Memorize the **default limits** (25, 30, 45 mph).  
- Know that penalties **increase** with each offence.  
- Expect questions like: *“What is the maximum speed in a settlement?”*
