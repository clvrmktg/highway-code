## Vulnerable Road Users

Not everyone on the road is inside a car. Pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, and even animals are at greater risk in a collision. Drivers **must** take extra care around them, and these groups **must** also follow rules for their own safety.  

Most exam questions in this section focus on **who has priority** and **how to give space**.  

---

## Shared Principles

- **See and be seen:** Vulnerable users are smaller and harder to spot — especially at night or in bad weather. See [Low Visibility](/rules/special-conditions/low-visibility/).  
- **Give space:** Drivers must slow down and leave plenty of room when passing cyclists, motorcyclists, or animals.  
- **Expect the unexpected:** Children, pets, or riders may make sudden moves. Drive defensively.  
- **Priority:** Pedestrians at crossings, cyclists at junctions, and animals on the road all require you to yield.  
- **Patience and courtesy:** Aggressive driving puts lives at risk. The law requires consideration for all road users.{{< footnote id="1" >}}

## What You'll Learn in This Section

- [Pedestrians](/rules/vulnerable-users/pedestrians/) → You **must** give way at crossings, and pedestrians must use footpaths or walk facing traffic if none exist.  
- [Cyclists](/rules/vulnerable-users/cyclists/) → You **must** give space when overtaking; cyclists must use lights at night and obey traffic signals.  
- [Motorcyclists](/rules/vulnerable-users/motorcyclists/) → Riders and passengers **must** wear helmets; only one passenger is allowed.  
- [Animals](/rules/vulnerable-users/animals/) → Drivers **must** slow down and not frighten animals; handlers must keep control.

## Exam Pointers

- *Where should pedestrians walk if no footpath exists?* → On the right-hand side, facing traffic.  
- *What equipment must a cyclist have at night?* → Front white light, rear red light, and a bell or horn.  
- *What protective gear is legally required for motorcyclists?* → An approved helmet for both rider and passenger.  
- *How must you drive when animals are on the road?* → Slow down, give space, and never sound the horn.

{{< callout type="tip" title="Study Tip" >}}
- Examiners love questions about **priority**: Who has right of way — the pedestrian, cyclist, or driver?  
- A safe rule of thumb: *If in doubt, give way.*  
- Remember: the Highway Code balances **must** (legal duties) and **should** (safe practices). Vulnerable users often appear in both.
