## Animals on the Road

In The Bahamas, you may encounter animals on the road, including horses, cattle, goats, dogs, and stray cats. These can be unpredictable, and drivers **must** slow down and give them space.

## Legal Essentials

- You must take special care when animals are on or near the road.{{< footnote id="1" >}}  
- You must not scare, injure, or endanger animals with your driving.{{< footnote id="2" >}}  
- When riding or leading an animal, handlers must keep control and ensure the road is clear before moving across.{{< footnote id="1" >}}

## Good Practice

- **Slow down:** Reduce speed when passing animals on or near the road.  
- **Give space:** Leave plenty of room, especially for horses and livestock.  
- **Avoid noise:** Do not sound your horn or rev the engine near animals — it may frighten them.  
- **Be patient:** If animals are being herded across the road, stop and wait until they are clear.  
- **Watch for strays:** Be alert for pets or stray dogs and cats, especially at night or in residential areas. See [Low Visibility](/rules/special-conditions/low-visibility/).

## Special Considerations

- In rural areas, livestock may stray onto roads without warning.  
- On Family Islands, animals are often unfenced and may cross freely — drive at a speed that allows you to stop safely.  
- Horses may be ridden on roads — slow to a crawl, pass wide, and be prepared to stop if the rider signals.

## Exam Pointers

- You must know: drivers must slow and give space to animals, and must not scare or endanger them.{{< footnote id="1" >}}  
- Expect questions like: *“What should you do if cattle are crossing the road?”* → stop, wait patiently, and only proceed when the road is clear.  
- You should know: horns and loud noises can frighten animals — avoid using them nearby.
