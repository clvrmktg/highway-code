## Cyclists

Cyclists share the road with motor vehicles but are more vulnerable. You **must** make yourself visible, obey the rules of the road, and ride with caution.

## Legal Essentials

- You must obey all traffic lights, signs, and road markings.{{< footnote id="2" >}}  
- You must ride on the left-hand side of the road, in the same direction as traffic.  
- You must use a front white light and rear red light when riding at night.{{< footnote id="1" >}}  
- Your bicycle must have a working bell or horn.{{< footnote id="1" >}}  
- You must not carry passengers unless the bicycle is designed to do so.

## Good Practice

These are steps you **should** follow:

- **Visibility:** Wear bright or reflective clothing, especially at night or in poor weather. See [Low Visibility](/rules/special-conditions/low-visibility/).  
- **Signals:** Give clear hand signals before turning or changing lanes.  
- **Lane position:** Keep a steady line and avoid weaving between vehicles. Stay out of drivers’ blind spots. See [Lane Discipline](/rules/lane-discipline/).  
- **Control:** Always keep at least one hand on the handlebars.  
- **Awareness:** Watch for opening car doors, potholes, or loose gravel.

## Special Considerations

- Children should not cycle on busy roads until they are confident and supervised.  
- Cyclists should ride single file on busy or narrow roads. See [Hills & Narrow Roads](/rules/special-conditions/hills-narrow-roads/).  
- Helmets are strongly recommended for safety, even if not legally required.

## Exam Pointers

- You must know: front white light, rear red light, and a bell or horn are required by law.{{< footnote id="1" >}}  
- You must ride with the flow of traffic, not against it.  
- Expect questions like: *“What signals should a cyclist use when turning?”* → clear hand signals.  
- You should know: reflective clothing and helmets improve safety.

- Watch out for trick questions about carrying passengers — the answer is always **no, unless designed for it**.  
- Cross-check with [Lane Discipline](/rules/lane-discipline/) and [Low Visibility](/rules/special-conditions/low-visibility/) for related exam prep.
