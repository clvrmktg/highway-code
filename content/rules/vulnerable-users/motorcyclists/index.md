## Motorcyclists

Motorcycles are smaller and less visible than cars, which makes riding riskier. Riders and passengers **must** use proper protective equipment and ride with care to reduce danger.

## Legal Essentials

- You must wear an approved safety helmet when riding. Passengers must also wear helmets.{{< footnote id="1" >}}  
- You must not carry more than one passenger.{{< footnote id="2" >}}  
- You must keep both hands on the handlebars except when signalling.{{< footnote id="2" >}}  
- You must obey traffic lights, signals, and road signs just like other drivers.

## Good Practice

These are steps riders **should** follow:

- **Protective clothing:** Wear sturdy boots, gloves, and bright or reflective clothing to improve visibility.  
- **Lane position:** Keep a safe, visible position in your lane. Avoid riding in drivers’ blind spots. See [Lane Discipline](/rules/lane-discipline/).  
- **Distance:** Maintain a safe following distance — motorcycles stop more quickly than cars, but are less stable in wet or rough conditions. See [Speed](/rules/speed/).  
- **Awareness:** Watch for hazards like potholes, oil spills, and wet road markings, which are especially dangerous on two wheels.  
- **Signalling:** Give clear, early signals before turning or changing lanes.

## Special Considerations

- Riders should take extra care in rain or at night when visibility is reduced. See [Low Visibility](/rules/special-conditions/low-visibility/).  
- Motorcycles are harder for other drivers to see — assume you are not visible until you make yourself obvious.  
- Carrying children is dangerous — if unavoidable, ensure they are properly seated with helmet and secure footrests.

## Exam Pointers

- You must know that helmets are compulsory for both rider and passenger.{{< footnote id="1" >}}  
- You must remember: only one passenger allowed, and both hands must stay on handlebars (except to signal).{{< footnote id="2" >}}  
- Expect questions like: *“What protective gear should a motorcyclist wear?”* → helmet, boots, gloves, bright/reflective clothing.
