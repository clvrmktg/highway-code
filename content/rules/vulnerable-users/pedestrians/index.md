## Pedestrians

Pedestrians are the most vulnerable road users. Drivers **must** give them priority at crossings and drive carefully anywhere people are walking. Pedestrians also **must** take responsibility for their own safety by using crossings where available and being visible.

## Legal Essentials

- Drivers must give way to pedestrians on pedestrian crossings.{{< footnote id="2" >}}  
- Pedestrians must not step suddenly into the path of a moving vehicle.{{< footnote id="1" >}}  
- Where a footpath is provided, pedestrians must use it.{{< footnote id="1" >}}  
- If no footpath is available, pedestrians must walk on the right-hand side of the road facing oncoming traffic.{{< footnote id="1" >}}

## Good Practice

- **Crossing the road:** Use pedestrian crossings where provided. If there is none, choose a place with good visibility in both directions.  
- **At night:** Wear or carry something light or reflective to be seen by drivers. See [Low Visibility](/rules/special-conditions/low-visibility/).  
- **Children:** Young children should not be allowed near roads unsupervised. Always hold their hand when crossing.  
- **Groups:** Large groups should keep to the right-hand side of the road, in single file if necessary.  
- **Avoid distractions:** Do not use phones or headphones when crossing roads.

## Special Considerations

- At intersections, always look both ways and make sure traffic has stopped before stepping onto the crossing. See [Junctions](/rules/junctions/).  
- Be alert for vehicles reversing out of driveways or parking spaces. See [Reversing](/rules/reversing/).  
- On rural roads without sidewalks, be extra careful at night — carry a flashlight or wear reflective clothing.

## Exam Pointers

- You must know: pedestrians should use footpaths where available, or walk on the right-hand side facing traffic if not.{{< footnote id="1" >}}  
- You must know: drivers must give way to pedestrians at crossings.{{< footnote id="2" >}}  
- Expect questions like: *“Where should pedestrians walk if there is no footpath?”* → On the right, facing oncoming traffic.  
- You should know: at night, pedestrians should wear light or reflective clothing.

{{< callout type="tip" title="Study Tip" >}}
- Examiners often test **who has priority**: the safe answer is that **drivers must give way at crossings**.  
- Another common trap: *Which side should pedestrians walk on without a footpath?* — the answer is always **right side, facing traffic**.  
- Cross-check with [Low Visibility](/rules/special-conditions/low-visibility/) and [Junctions](/rules/junctions/) for related exam prep.
