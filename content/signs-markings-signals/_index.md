## Signs, Markings & Signals

Every driver must understand the **three systems of traffic control** used on Bahamian roads:

- [**Traffic Signs**]({{< relref "traffic-signs" >}}) — Fixed roadside boards that **regulate**, **warn**, or **guide**.  
- [**Road Markings**]({{< relref "road-markings" >}}) — Painted **lines, arrows, symbols** on the road surface.  
- [**Traffic Signals**]({{< relref "traffic-signals" >}}) — **Dynamic** controls (traffic lights, pedestrian lights, driver hand signals, and police directions).

Together, these ensure safe and predictable movement for all road users.

## Why They Matter

- **Safety:** Reduce crashes and confusion.  
- **Clarity:** A shared language for everyone on the road.  
- **Law:** Drivers **must obey** signs, markings, and signals at all times.

Expect multiple-choice questions that require you to **recognise the sign/marking/signal**, **state its meaning**, and **apply it correctly** in a scenario.

## How They Work Together

- **When signals operate**, they **override** conflicting signs/markings.  
- **Markings** (e.g., stop lines, arrows) tell you **where** to stop or which **movement** is permitted.  
- **Signs** give you the **rule** (e.g., yield, speed limit); **markings/signals** show **how/when** to apply it.

{{< callout type="warning" title="Remember" >}}
Ignoring any of these—signs, markings, or signals—can result in penalties and collisions. Always follow the most **immediate** control (typically signals), unless a police officer is directing traffic, in which case **their instructions come first**.
