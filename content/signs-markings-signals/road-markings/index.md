## Road Markings

**Road markings** are painted directly on the road surface. They show drivers **where to drive, stop, or cross**, and help keep traffic organised.  

Like traffic signs, they are **legally enforceable** — you must follow them at all times.

### Common Types of Road Markings

- **Lane Lines** — Divide the road into lanes. Solid lines mean *do not cross*; broken lines may be crossed when safe.  
- **Centre Lines** — Show the division of opposing traffic. Double solid lines must not be crossed.  
- **Stop Lines** — Thick white lines across the road where you must stop at a STOP sign or traffic signal.  
- **Pedestrian Crossings** — “Zebra stripes” showing where pedestrians have priority to cross.  
- **Arrows** — Indicate permitted directions (straight, left, right, or combinations).  
- **Zig-Zag Lines** — Found near pedestrian crossings; no stopping, waiting, or overtaking allowed.  
- **Parking Bays / Restrictions** — Marked boxes or yellow lines indicating where you may or may not park.
