## Traffic Signals

**Traffic signals** are dynamic controls that change in real time to manage the flow of vehicles and pedestrians.  
They include **traffic lights, pedestrian lights, driver hand signals, and police officer directions**.  

Drivers **must obey these signals at all times**, even if they appear to conflict with road markings or fixed signs.  
If a police officer is directing traffic, **their instructions override everything else**.

---

## Traffic Lights {#lights}

- **Red:** Stop and wait behind the stop line.  
- **Amber (Yellow):** Stop unless it is unsafe to do so.  
- **Green:** Go if the way is clear.  

Special notes:  
- Do not block intersections.  
- Give way to pedestrians crossing on the green man.  

---

## Pedestrian Signals {#pedestrian}

- **Green man (steady):** Pedestrians may cross with care.  
- **Flashing green man:** Do not start to cross; the signal is about to change.  
- **Red man:** Pedestrians must not cross.  

Drivers must stop and allow pedestrians to cross when signals are red for vehicles.  

---

## Hand Signals {#hand}

Drivers may use hand signals if indicators are not working or to make intentions clear:

- **Left turn:** Extend left arm straight out.  
- **Right turn:** Extend left arm, bent upward at the elbow.  
- **Slowing down / stopping:** Extend left arm, bent downward with palm facing back.  

---

## Police Officer Signals {#police}

When a police officer is directing traffic, **their signals override traffic lights and signs**:

- **Hand raised (palm out):** Stop.  
- **Arm waved forward:** Proceed ahead.  
- **Arm extended to the side:** Traffic in that lane must stop.  
- **Beckoning motion:** Driver should move forward from the officer’s direction.  

Failing to obey a police officer’s signals is an offence under the Road Traffic Act.
