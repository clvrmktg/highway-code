## Introduction to Traffic Signs

Traffic signs are a **universal language of the road**. They tell drivers what they **must do**, **must not do**, or should be **alert for**.

Together with road markings and traffic signals, they create a system that keeps traffic safe and predictable.

## Why Traffic Signs Matter

- **Safety:** Prevents collisions and confusion.  
- **Clarity:** Provides a shared set of rules for all road users.  
- **Law:** Section 63 of the Road Traffic Act (Ch. 220) requires drivers to obey traffic signs.

## How This Section Works

This part of the Highway Code explains the different kinds of signs and how to read them:

- [**The Signing System**]({{< relref "signing-system" >}}) — Shapes, colours, supplementary plates, and temporary signs.  
- [**Regulatory Signs**]({{< relref "regulatory" >}}) — Mandatory rules (STOP, Yield, No Entry, Speed Limits).  
- [**Warning Signs**]({{< relref "warning" >}}) — Hazard alerts (curves, animals, school zones, junctions).  
- [**Guide & Information Signs**]({{< relref "guide-information" >}}) — Directions, distances, services, and facilities.  
- [**Temporary Signs**]({{< relref "temporary" >}}) — Roadworks, detours, and short-term controls.

Expect multiple-choice questions on both **recognising signs** and **applying their meaning**.  
You should also be able to identify the category of a sign based on its **shape and colour**.
