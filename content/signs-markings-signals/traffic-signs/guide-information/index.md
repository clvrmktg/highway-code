## Guide & Information Signs

**Guide and information signs** provide helpful details for drivers, such as **directions, distances, services, and facilities**.  
Unlike regulatory or warning signs, they do not give commands — but they are vital for **navigation and safety**.  

They are usually **rectangular** and may be blue, green, or white with clear symbols or text.
