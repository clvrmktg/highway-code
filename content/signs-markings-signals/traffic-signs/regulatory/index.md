## Regulatory Signs

**Regulatory signs** are the **law of the road**. They tell drivers what they **must do** or **must not do**.  
They are usually **circular (for commands)**, **triangular (for Yield/Give Way)**, or **octagonal (STOP)**.  

Drivers must **obey all regulatory signs at all times**. Ignoring them is an offence under the Road Traffic Act.
