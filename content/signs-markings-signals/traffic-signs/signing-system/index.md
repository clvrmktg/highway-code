## The Signing System

Traffic signs follow an **international system of shapes and colours** so that drivers can recognise their meaning instantly, even at speed.
  
The Bahamian Highway Code uses the same conventions as most countries, based on the **Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals**.

There are three basic types of traffic sign:
- **Signs that give orders** (what you must or must not do)  
- **Signs that warn** (hazards ahead)  
- **Signs that give information** (directions, facilities, services)  

Each type has its own **shape and colour rules**.

---

## Shapes and Meanings

- **Circles** → Give orders.  
  - **Red circle / ring:** What you **must not** do (e.g., No Entry, No U-turn, No vehicles over 3m high, Speed limits).  
  - **Blue circle:** What you **must do** (a mandatory instruction such as Turn left, Keep right, or a reserved route for buses/cycles).  

- **Triangles (red border)** → Warn of hazards (e.g., bends, junctions, animals, schools).  
- **Rectangles** → Give information (e.g., directions, parking, services).  
  - **Blue rectangles:** Information signs (except on motorways, where they give directions).  
  - **Green rectangles:** Direction signs on primary routes.  
  - **White rectangles:** Direction signs on local roads, or used as plates with other signs.  
  - **Brown rectangles:** Tourist information and attractions.  

- **Special cases:**  
  - **STOP** = red **octagon** (unique worldwide, instantly recognised).  
  - **YIELD (Give Way)** = red **inverted triangle**.

## Supplementary Plates

Plates mounted **under a main sign** provide extra details:  
- **Time limits:** “7–9 am, Mon–Fri”  
- **Distance/length:** “200 m” or “Next 2 km”  
- **Vehicle classes:** “Except buses” / “Goods vehicles only”  

These plates **modify the meaning of the sign above them** and are legally part of the instruction.

## Temporary Signs

Temporary signs are often **yellow or orange**. 

They are used for **roadworks, detours, or emergencies** and carry the same **legal force** as permanent signs.
