## Temporary (Roadworks) Signs

**Temporary signs** are used for **roadworks, diversions, and short-term changes** on the road.  
They are usually **yellow or orange**, or mounted on portable boards and barriers.  

These signs are **just as enforceable as permanent signs**. Ignoring them can lead to accidents and penalties.

## Common Temporary Signs

- **Roadworks Ahead** — Prepare to slow down; men and machinery may be working on or near the road.  
- **STOP/GO Control** — A flagman or sign controls traffic through the work zone. Obey their signal.  
- **Detour / Diversion** — Follow the indicated route around a closed section of road.  
- **Road Closed** — The road ahead is closed to all traffic.  
- **Lane Closed / Merge** — Traffic lanes reduce; merge safely when instructed.  
- **Temporary Speed Limit** — Slow down to the posted temporary speed (e.g., 25 km/h).  
- **Uneven Surface / Loose Chippings** — Roadworks may leave temporary hazards.
