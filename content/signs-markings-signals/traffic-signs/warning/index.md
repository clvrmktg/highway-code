## Warning Signs

**Warning signs** are used to alert drivers about **hazards, dangers, or changes in road conditions** ahead.  
They are usually **triangular in shape**, with a red border and a clear black symbol.  

Drivers should **slow down, observe carefully, and be ready to act safely** when approaching these signs.
